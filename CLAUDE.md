### Recent Changes

#### QA Warning Fixes (Apr 2026)

- **Immediate portal upload email:** Portal extract route now sends an email to the PM immediately via Resend when a vendor/tenant uploads a COI through the self-service portal (portal/[token]/extract/route.ts). Cron-based notifications remain unchanged.
- **Persist entity names on templates:** Added `additional_insured_name` and `certificate_holder_name` columns to `requirement_templates` table (migration: 20260401_add_template_entity_names.sql). Lease extraction dialog now passes entity names through to `createTemplateWithRequirements()`. Template editor displays and saves entity names for lease-extracted templates. Updated `RequirementTemplate` type, `CreateTemplateWithRequirementsInput`, and `UpdateTemplateInput` interfaces.

#### QA Audit (Apr 2026)

Full end-to-end audit of 7 critical user flows. **All 7 flows PASS** — no blocking bugs found. Warnings documented for Tony to triage:
- **WARN:** No explicit timeout on AI extraction `fetch()` call (extraction.ts) — relies on Node defaults
- **WARN:** Stripe webhook handles `invoice.payment_succeeded` but not `invoice.paid` — functionally equivalent but not best practice
- ~~**WARN:** Portal upload creates notification record in DB but doesn't trigger immediate email send — relies on cron scheduler~~ **FIXED**
- ~~**WARN:** Additional Insured / Certificate Holder entity names from lease extraction are displayed in review but not persisted to template (only boolean flags saved per requirement)~~ **FIXED**
- **WARN:** Trial banner won't auto-refresh if trial expires while dashboard is open (server-side blocking works correctly)

#### Landing Page Dashboard Preview Update (Apr 2026)

- **Removed Portfolio Overview card** from landing page mock sidebar (matches actual dashboard after P1 changes)
- **Updated Recent Activity** from 4 to 8 sample items with realistic entries (matches actual dashboard's 8-item feed)
- **Removed unused components:** `PortfolioOverviewCard`, `BuildingSmIcon` from hero-dashboard.tsx
- Action buttons and currency formatting verified as already consistent — no changes needed

#### P0 Critical Fixes (Mar 2026)

- **Vendor/tenant name overflow:** Breadcrumb names truncated to 40 chars, h1 headers truncated with CSS ellipsis + title tooltip for full name on hover (vendor-detail-client.tsx, tenant-detail-client.tsx)
- **Currency formatting:** Added `formatDisplayLimit()` utility in `lib/utils.ts`. All coverage limit number inputs now show formatted dollar amount hint below (e.g., "$1,000,000") in entity-creation-wizard, template-editor, extract-lease-dialog, template-assignment-nudge, and onboarding step-templates
- **Email validation:** Contact email in Add Vendor/Tenant wizard (Step 1) now validated with regex on blur. Invalid emails show inline error and prevent advancing to Step 2. Empty email is still allowed (optional field)
- **Consistent action queue buttons:** "Request COI" button now always shown for all action items (not just those with emails). Clicking without a contact email shows a toast: "No contact email on file. Edit this vendor to add one."
- **Auto-select single property:** Legacy upload-coi-dialog now auto-selects and shows static property name when only one property exists (SimpleUploadCOIDialog already had this)

#### P1 Polish Pass (Mar 2026)

- **Coverage comparison layout:** Vendor/tenant detail pages now show found vs required limits side by side ("$2,000,000 / $1,000,000 req") instead of at opposite ends of the row (compact-compliance-view.tsx)
- **Wizard coverage row cleanup:** Endorsement checkboxes replaced with compact toggleable chips (AI, WoS, P&NC) in entity-creation-wizard, extract-lease-dialog, and template-assignment-nudge. Coverage type inputs use `flex-1` for full width. "Why?" button uses emerald pill style with icon.
- **Lease extraction dialog:** Auto-generates template name from entity name if available (e.g., "Golds Gym — Lease Requirements"). Added review guidance note. Ambiguous/null limits show yellow "(review)" warning. `entityName` prop added to `ExtractLeaseDialog`.
- **Dashboard sidebar:** Removed redundant Portfolio Overview card (data already in compliance health bar). Activity feed increased from 5 to 8 items. Removed unused `SummaryCard`, `SummaryStatBlock` components, `Building2` import.
- **Title case utility:** Added `toTitleCase()` to `lib/utils.ts` (preserves LLC, HVAC, INC, etc.). Applied to AI-recommended and lease extraction template names in entity-creation-wizard.

### Known Issues

- Anthropic API 529 errors during bulk upload (retry logic with exponential backoff in place)
- Tutorial walkthrough positioning edge cases

## Architecture Notes

### Compliance Pipeline

COIs follow this flow: **Upload → AI Extraction (two-pass) → Automatic Compliance Calculation**. There is no manual review step. After extraction completes, compliance results are computed automatically using the property's assigned requirement template. Fuzzy name matching (Levenshtein distance) is used for certificate holder and additional insured verification, with a configurable `accept_cert_holder_in_additional_insured` toggle per property.

Two-pass AI extraction:
1. **Pass 1 (ACORD 25):** Extracts coverage types, limits (per-occurrence + aggregate as separate entries), dates, carriers, named insureds, certificate holder, additional insured from page 1.
2. **Pass 2 (Endorsements):** Scans pages 2+ for CG 20 10, CG 20 37, Waiver of Subrogation, Primary & Non-Contributory endorsements. Endorsement data stored in `certificates.endorsement_data` JSONB column.

### Lease Requirement Extraction

Lease PDFs can be uploaded to extract insurance requirements into compliance templates. Flow: **Upload Lease PDF → AI Extraction → Review/Edit Requirements → Save as Template**. Uses the same Anthropic API with a lease-specific prompt. Templates created this way have `source_type = 'lease_extraction'` and show an "Extracted from Lease" badge. Counts against extraction credits.

### Authentication

- Email/password with confirm password field on signup
- Google OAuth via Supabase Auth (client ID configured in Supabase dashboard)
- Forgot password / reset password flow via Supabase Auth
- Trial period (`trial_ends_at`) set correctly on org creation for both email and Google OAuth signups
- Auth callback (`/api/auth/callback`) uses request-aware Supabase client to correctly propagate auth cookies on redirect responses (critical for OAuth and email confirmation flows)

No shared components between marketing and dashboard.

## Database

All migrations are consolidated in `supabase/consolidated_post_v2_migrations.sql`. Run migrations against production via the Supabase SQL Editor. The file is idempotent and safe to re-run.

19 tables with RLS scoped by `organization_id`: organizations, users, properties, property_entities, organization_default_entities, requirement_templates, template_coverage_requirements, vendors, tenants, certificates, extracted_coverages, extracted_entities, compliance_results, entity_compliance_results, notifications, upload_portal_tokens, activity_log, compliance_waivers, compliance_snapshots.

Notable columns:
- `properties.accept_cert_holder_in_additional_insured` — boolean toggle for fuzzy matching flexibility
- `properties.certificate_holder` / `properties.additional_insured` — entity name fields for compliance verification
- `certificates.endorsement_data` — JSONB column for endorsement extraction results
- `requirement_templates.source_type` — TEXT ('manual' | 'lease_extraction' | 'ai_recommended') indicating template origin
- `requirement_templates.additional_insured_name` / `requirement_templates.certificate_holder_name` — entity names extracted from leases, persisted for compliance matching

## Important Patterns

- **Server actions** use `requireAuth()` from `src/lib/actions/auth.ts` to get `{ userId, orgId }`. Throws if not authenticated.
- **Service role client** (`src/lib/supabase/service.ts`) bypasses RLS for admin operations like portal uploads, profile creation, plan checks.
- **Plan enforcement:** `checkActivePlan()` from `src/lib/require-active-plan.ts` returns `{ error }` for inactive plans. `checkVendorTenantLimit()` and `checkExtractionLimit()` from `src/lib/plan-limits.ts` enforce per-plan quotas. Trial extraction limit is 50.
- **After mutations:** call `revalidatePath()` to refresh server components.
- **Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`) checks for `smartcoi-session` cookie before refreshing auth tokens. No cookie = expired session = redirect to `/login`. Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- **Session management** (`src/lib/session.ts`) uses a browser cookie (`smartcoi-session`) as a server-readable session marker (24h or 7d max-age) plus localStorage for inactivity tracking. `SessionGuard` component in the dashboard layout checks both.
- **Compliance pipeline:** No manual review step. Extraction → automatic compliance calculation. Fuzzy name matching for certificate holder and additional insured.
- **Bulk upload:** Batch processing with 5 concurrent files, exponential backoff retry (2s/4s/8s) on Anthropic API 529 errors.
- **Google OAuth:** Handled via Supabase Auth callback at `/api/auth/callback`. Uses request-aware `createServerClient` (not `cookies()` from next/headers) to ensure auth tokens are set on the redirect response. Trial period assigned on org creation for both email and OAuth signups.
- **Lease extraction:** API route at `/api/leases/extract`. Uses `src/lib/ai/lease-extraction.ts` with lease-specific prompt. Counts against extraction credits via `checkExtractionLimit()`.

## Conventions

- Always flag manual steps (SQL migrations, env vars, Supabase dashboard settings, Stripe config) with ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED at the end of every summary.
- Always read CLAUDE.md before starting work.
- Check existing code before making changes — update don't duplicate.
- Blog posts are MDX files in `src/content/blog/` with frontmatter: `title`, `description`, `date`, `author` (use "SmartCOI Team").
- All public pages must use absolute canonical URLs (`https://smartcoi.io/...`). Domain is smartcoi.io (not .com).
- `trailingSlash: false` in Next.js config.
- Sessions expire after 24 hours (7 days with "Remember me").
- Emerald-teal brand palette throughout dashboard and landing page.

## Slash Commands

- `/blog` — Blog post creation workflow (generates MDX with frontmatter)
- `/audit` — Full consistency audit across the codebase
