              SmartCOI is operated by SmartCOI (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;,
              &quot;our&quot;). By accessing or using the SmartCOI service, you
              agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to
              these terms, please do not use the service.

            <h2>Service Description</h2>
            <p>
              SmartCOI provides AI-powered certificate of insurance (COI)
              compliance tracking for commercial property managers. The service
              extracts data from uploaded PDF documents using artificial
              intelligence and checks coverage against user-configured
              requirements. It also provides tools for vendor and tenant
              management, automated notifications, and compliance dashboards.

            <h2>AI Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
              SmartCOI uses artificial intelligence to extract and analyze
              insurance certificate data. While we strive for accuracy, AI
              extraction is not perfect. Users are responsible for reviewing and
              confirming all extracted data before relying on it for compliance
              decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              SmartCOI does not provide legal, insurance, or compliance advice.
              The service is a tool to assist property managers &mdash; it does
              not replace professional judgment or legal counsel.

              Each account is associated with a single organization. You are
              responsible for maintaining the security of your account
              credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.
