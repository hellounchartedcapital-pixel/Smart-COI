            What Is COI Tracking Software?
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              COI tracking software is a specialized tool that helps organizations collect, verify,
              and monitor Certificates of Insurance from vendors, contractors, and tenants. Instead
              of managing insurance compliance through spreadsheets, email attachments, and filing
              cabinets, COI tracking software centralizes everything in a single system with
              automated workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
              For commercial property managers, COI tracking software solves a specific and painful
              problem: ensuring that every third party operating on your properties carries the
              insurance coverage required by their contract or lease. This includes verifying coverage
              types, checking that policy limits meet your minimums, confirming that your entities are
              listed as additional insured, and monitoring expiration dates across your entire vendor
              and tenant base.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best COI tracking software goes beyond simple document storage. It extracts data from
              certificate PDFs, compares that data against your requirements automatically, and alerts
              you when certificates expire or fall out of compliance — so you can focus on managing
              properties rather than chasing paperwork.

        {/* Why Property Managers Need It */}
        <section className="mx-auto mt-16 max-w-4xl px-6">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-950 sm:text-3xl">
            Why Property Managers Need Dedicated COI Tracking
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              Commercial property management creates unique COI tracking challenges. A single property
              might have 20-50 vendors — landscapers, HVAC contractors, electricians, janitorial
              services, security companies, elevator maintenance crews — each with their own insurance
              policies and expiration dates. Multiply that across a portfolio of properties and you
              are looking at hundreds of certificates to track.
            </p>
            <p>
              Manual tracking breaks down at this scale. Spreadsheets grow unwieldy. Emails get buried.
              Expired certificates go unnoticed for months. And when something goes wrong — a contractor
              injury, property damage, a tenant liability claim — the first question will be whether
              proper insurance was in place. If it was not, your organization bears the exposure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Property managers also face pressure from multiple directions: lenders require evidence
              of third-party insurance compliance, investors expect professional risk management, and
              your own insurance carrier may condition coverage on having a verified COI tracking
              program. Dedicated software makes all of this manageable.

        {/* How SmartCOI Differs */}
        <section className="mx-auto mt-16 max-w-4xl px-6">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-950 sm:text-3xl">
            How SmartCOI&apos;s AI-Powered Approach Is Different
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              Traditional COI tracking software digitizes the process but still requires manual data
              entry. You upload a PDF and then type the coverage information into form fields yourself.
              Some legacy solutions use basic OCR technology that struggles with the varied layouts of
              insurance certificates and frequently produces errors that require manual correction.
            </p>
            <p>
              SmartCOI takes a fundamentally different approach. Our AI reads each certificate PDF the
              way a trained insurance professional would — understanding the structure of ACORD forms,
              identifying coverage types, extracting policy limits, reading effective and expiration
              dates, and recognizing named entities. The entire extraction happens in seconds, not
              minutes. And because the AI understands context rather than just matching text patterns,
              it handles the variations in certificate formatting that trip up traditional OCR.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once data is extracted, SmartCOI automatically compares it against your configured
              requirements. You see a clear compliance breakdown instantly — which requirements are
              met, which have gaps, and what the vendor needs to fix. No manual comparison needed.
