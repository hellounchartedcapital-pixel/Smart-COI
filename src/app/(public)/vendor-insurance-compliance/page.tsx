            Why Vendor Insurance Compliance Matters in CRE
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              Commercial properties rely on a network of vendors and contractors — landscapers,
              HVAC technicians, electricians, plumbers, janitorial services, security firms,
              construction crews, elevator maintenance companies, and more. Each of these vendors
              brings unique risks onto your property. A contractor could cause property damage.
              A maintenance worker could be injured on-site. A service provider could create a
              liability situation that exposes your organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vendor insurance compliance is the practice of ensuring that every vendor carries
              the insurance coverage specified in their contract before they perform work on your
              property. This typically includes general liability, workers&apos; compensation,
              automobile liability (for vendors using vehicles on-site), and sometimes specialty
              coverages like pollution liability or professional liability depending on the work
              being performed.
            </p>
            <p>
              When vendor insurance compliance is properly managed, your organization is protected.
              If an incident occurs, the vendor&apos;s insurance responds first. When compliance
              lapses — an expired policy, insufficient limits, a missing additional insured
              endorsement — your organization may bear liability that should have been the
              vendor&apos;s responsibility.

            How SmartCOI Automates Vendor Compliance

            <p>
              SmartCOI replaces the manual vendor compliance workflow with an automated system.
              Define your insurance requirements using customizable templates — set minimum limits
              for each coverage type, mark required endorsements, and specify the entities that
              must be listed as additional insured. Assign templates to vendors based on the type
              of work they perform.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a vendor&apos;s certificate is uploaded — either by your team or by the vendor
              through the self-service portal — SmartCOI&apos;s AI extracts all data from the
              certificate PDF in seconds and checks it against the assigned requirements. You see
              instantly whether the vendor is compliant, what gaps exist, and what needs to be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
              SmartCOI monitors every expiration date and sends automated reminders to vendors at
              configurable intervals before their certificates expire. When a certificate falls out
              of compliance, the vendor receives a clear notification explaining exactly what needs to
              be updated, with a link to upload a new certificate through the self-service portal.
            </p>
          </div>

            The Vendor Experience: Self-Service Portal
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              SmartCOI includes a self-service upload portal that transforms the vendor experience.
              Instead of back-and-forth emails and confusion about what coverage is needed, each
              vendor receives a unique link to their portal page. There, they can see exactly what
              insurance requirements apply to them and upload their certificate directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              No vendor account is needed — just a link. The vendor uploads their certificate PDF,
              SmartCOI&apos;s AI extracts and checks the data automatically, and your team is
              notified only when human review is needed. This reduces the administrative burden on
              both sides and dramatically speeds up the compliance process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vendors appreciate the transparency. Instead of wondering why their certificate was
              rejected, they can see the specific requirements and understand exactly what their
              broker needs to provide.
