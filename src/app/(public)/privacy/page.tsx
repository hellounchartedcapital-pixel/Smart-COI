            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Account information</h3>
            <p>
              Name, email address, and organization name, provided during
              registration.
            </p>

            <h3>Property and vendor/tenant data</h3>
            <p>
              Property names, addresses, vendor and tenant company names, and
              contact email addresses, entered by users within the application.
            </p>

            <h3>Insurance documents</h3>
            <p>
              Certificate of Insurance (COI) PDF files uploaded by users or
              their vendors and tenants through the self-service portal.
            </p>

            <h3>Vendor and tenant portal data</h3>
            <p>
              When vendors or tenants upload certificates through the
              self-service portal, we collect the uploaded document and any
              information extracted from it (company names, coverage details,
              policy dates). Portal users do not create accounts, but their
              uploaded documents are stored and processed within the
              organization&apos;s SmartCOI account that issued the portal link.
            </p>

            <h3>Usage data</h3>
            <p>
              Pages visited, features used, and timestamps, collected
              automatically to help us improve the service.
            </p>

            <h3>Payment information</h3>
            <p>
              Payment processing is handled by Stripe. We do not store credit
              card numbers or full payment details on our servers.

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <h3>To provide the service</h3>
            <p>
              We use your data to extract information from COI documents, check
              compliance against your configured requirements, and send
              notifications about coverage gaps and expirations.
            </p>

            <h3>AI processing</h3>
            <p>
              Uploaded PDF documents are sent to Anthropic&apos;s Claude API for
              data extraction. Anthropic processes the document content to
              extract structured insurance data.
            </p>
            <p>
              SmartCOI uses Anthropic&apos;s commercial API, which does not use
              your data to train AI models. Document content is processed in
              real time and is not stored by Anthropic beyond the duration of
              the API request, in accordance with Anthropic&apos;s API data
              policies. For full details, see{' '}
