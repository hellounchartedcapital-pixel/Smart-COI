            Commercial leases require tenants to maintain insurance — but verifying and tracking
            tenant COIs across a portfolio is a constant challenge. SmartCOI automates the process

            Why Tenant Insurance Tracking Is Critical
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              Nearly every commercial lease contains insurance requirements. Tenants are typically
              required to carry general liability insurance, property insurance for their contents
              and improvements, and sometimes specialty coverages depending on their business type —
              liquor liability for restaurants and bars, professional liability for medical or legal
              tenants, pollution liability for dry cleaners or auto shops.
            </p>
            <p>
              These requirements exist for good reason. When a tenant causes damage to the building,
              injures a visitor, or creates a liability situation, their insurance should respond
              first. Without it, the property owner bears the exposure. A fire in a tenant space
              without adequate property insurance, a slip-and-fall with no general liability coverage,
              a lease default with no loss of income protection — these are scenarios that can cost
              property owners hundreds of thousands of dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge is not just collecting certificates at lease signing. It is maintaining
              compliance throughout the lease term. Tenant insurance policies expire and are renewed
              annually. Coverage changes happen. Tenants switch carriers. Without ongoing monitoring,
              a tenant who was compliant on day one may have lapsed coverage by month eight — and
              nobody knows until something goes wrong.

            How SmartCOI Handles Tenant Insurance
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              SmartCOI treats tenant insurance tracking with the same rigor as vendor compliance.
              Tenants are managed alongside vendors in a unified system — each with their own
              insurance requirements, compliance status, certificate history, and notification
              settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Create requirement templates tailored to tenant types: a standard office tenant
              template, a restaurant tenant template with liquor liability, a medical tenant
              template with professional liability. Assign the appropriate template when adding
              a tenant, and SmartCOI handles the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a tenant&apos;s certificate is uploaded, the AI extracts all data and checks
              compliance against the assigned requirements. The system tracks expiration dates and
              sends automated renewal reminders to tenants before their policies lapse. Tenants can
              upload updated certificates through the same self-service portal used by vendors — no
              special accounts, just a link.
            </p>
            <p>
              For property managers who handle both vendor and tenant insurance, having both in one
              system eliminates the need for separate tracking processes. One dashboard shows
              compliance status for every third party across every property in your portfolio.

        {/* Notification Workflows */}
        <section className="mx-auto mt-16 max-w-4xl px-6">

            Automated Notification Workflows
          </h2>

            <p>
              Following up on tenant insurance is one of the most time-consuming parts of property
              management. SmartCOI automates this entirely with configurable notification workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
              The system sends tiered reminders before certificate expiration — typically at 60, 30,
              14, and 7 days. Each notification clearly explains what coverage needs to be renewed and
              includes a link to the tenant&apos;s upload portal. If a compliance gap is found in a
              newly submitted certificate, the tenant receives a notification explaining the specific
              issue and what their broker needs to correct.
            </p>
            <p>
              You maintain full control. Pause notifications for individual tenants when needed — during
              lease negotiations, for example. Resume when ready. The dashboard shows you exactly who
              has been notified, when, and whether they have responded.
