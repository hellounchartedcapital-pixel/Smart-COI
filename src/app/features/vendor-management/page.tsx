            The Vendor Insurance Challenge
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              Managing vendor insurance is one of the most time-consuming aspects of property
              management. Every landscaper, HVAC contractor, cleaning service, and construction
              crew needs to carry adequate insurance before stepping foot on your property. That
              means collecting certificates, verifying coverage, and — the biggest headache of
              all — chasing vendors for updated documents when things expire.
            </p>
            <p>
              The typical workflow is brutal: you email the vendor requesting a certificate,
              they forward your email to their insurance broker, the broker generates a
              certificate (maybe with your requirements, maybe not), the vendor emails it
              back to you, and then you manually review it. If something&apos;s wrong — a
              limit is too low, your entity isn&apos;t listed as additional insured — the
              whole cycle starts over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across a portfolio of properties with dozens of vendors each, this creates an
              avalanche of administrative work. Certificates slip through the cracks. Expired
              policies go unnoticed. And your risk exposure grows silently.

            A Better Way to Manage Vendor Insurance

            <p>
              SmartCOI transforms vendor insurance management from a reactive scramble into a
              proactive, automated system. Each vendor is tracked with their assigned insurance
              requirements, current compliance status, and full certificate history.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a vendor&apos;s certificate needs updating — whether due to compliance gaps
              or approaching expiration — SmartCOI sends automated notifications with a clear
              explanation of what&apos;s needed. The vendor receives a link to a self-service
              upload portal where they can submit their new certificate directly. No email
              chains, no phone tag, no confusion about requirements.
