            The Problem with Manual COI Tracking
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              If you manage commercial properties, you know the pain. Every vendor, contractor,
              and tenant needs to carry adequate insurance — and proving it falls on you. That means
              collecting certificates of insurance from dozens (or hundreds) of parties, reading each
              one line by line, cross-referencing coverage limits against your requirements, and somehow
              keeping track of when everything expires.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most property management teams do this with spreadsheets, shared drives, and a lot of
              manual effort. Certificates come in as email attachments. Someone has to open each PDF,
              squint at the coverage table, manually type numbers into a spreadsheet, and hope they
              didn&apos;t miss anything. When a certificate expires, it&apos;s often weeks before
              anyone notices — leaving the property exposed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This approach doesn&apos;t scale. As your portfolio grows, the administrative burden
              grows exponentially. And the stakes are high: a single lapse in vendor insurance
              coverage can expose your organization to millions in liability.

            How SmartCOI Solves It
          </h2>
          <div className="mt-6 space-y-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            <p>
              SmartCOI replaces the spreadsheet with an intelligent, automated system built
              specifically for commercial real estate. Upload a certificate PDF and our AI reads
              the entire document in seconds — extracting every coverage type, policy limit,
              carrier name, effective date, and expiration date with high accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The extracted data is automatically compared against your property&apos;s insurance
              requirements. You see instantly whether a vendor&apos;s coverage meets your minimum
              limits, whether the right entities are listed as additional insured, and whether
              any policies are about to expire. No more manual comparison. No more missed gaps.
